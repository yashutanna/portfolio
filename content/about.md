I am a software engineer that has a passion for people, technology, and businesses where the two meet. 

## How I work

I enjoy working through complex problems by boiling them down to their core components to understand the underlying problem to be solved.

Bringing my extroverted, ideative, and competitive personality into my work allows me to bring concepts to life through rapid prototyping of malleable thought processes.

I interact with engineers, designers, product specialists and help align all team members to a common goal by integrating into the core team.
