## What we did
Build a marketing portal for PPRO's clients allowing for a centralised and powerful source of information

## Why we did it
As a silent provider, PPRO has a day-to-day responsibility to provide and dissemenate information to its clients about the Payment Gateway ecosystem. 

With information about multiple streams being available in various forms and channels, we built out a platform to allow PPRO's client to be able to stay up to date with all information that is relavant to them. 

Using AWS services as the primary cloud and service provider, we were able to achieve a cost effective solution that served as a springboard for future development for their digitization strategy.
