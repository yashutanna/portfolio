## What we did
Build a marketing portal for PPRO's clients allowing for a centralised and powerful source of information

## Why we did it
PPRO is an integration-centric payments company - with hundreds of clients using their gateway to integrate countless APIs.

Discover, PPROâ€™s partner portal, brings partners closer to the critical information they need to not only to integrate with PPRO's extensive catalogue of payment methods, but also to engage with PPRO through the portal.

With a white-labelled web portal that celebrates their brand, partners are able to generate up-to-date, branded collateral in real-time. This rich functionality empowers them to streamline their own sales and marketing processes.

PPRO Discover is the one-stop-shop for all materials partners need to build, run, and grow their business.
