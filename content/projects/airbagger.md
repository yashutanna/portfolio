## What we did
Launch a airbnb style service for luggage in Cape Town and Johannesburg

## Why we did it
We wanted to know if there was a possibility to create a market place for tourists in Johannesburg and Cape Town to store their luggage and smaller businesses to generate additional revenue by letting out their free space. 

The solution was ultimately to create a very lightweight website with a facebook chat bot that would allow Graeme to engage with potential customers and gauge whether this was something worth persuing as a business

we were able to deliver this in a matter of 1 month and were able to provide Graeme a quick way to test out his business idea in reality
