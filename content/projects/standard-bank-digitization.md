## What we did
Consolidate data from different parts of the bank to form a data pool using Neo4j

## Why we did it
With a proliferated view of a client in different product streams within a huge organisation, it becomes quite a horrible experience for an end client - particularly clients that span geographies. To solve this issue - we built a small prototype that linked different data sources from various parts of the bank using fuzzy matching and neo4j relationships to give us a better holistic view of a client and its organisation structure.
